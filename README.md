# Deck of Cards React Application

## Introduction

This project is a web application built using the ReactJS framework. The main purpose of the application is to simulate the manipulation of a deck of standard playing cards. It allows users to deal cards, reset the deck, toss selected cards, introduce wildcards, and reshuffle displayed cards. The project emphasizes the use of React concepts such as components, props, and state management with hooks, aiming to provide a professional and interactive user experience.

## Features

- ***Deck Display:*** An overturned deck of cards displayed on the page.

- ***Dealing Cards:*** Buttons to deal 5 or 7 cards randomly from the deck.

- ***Card Interaction:*** Cards can be clicked to select, swap, or highlight them.

- ***Reset Functionality:*** Reset the deck to its initial state with no displayed cards.

- ***Toss Function:*** Remove a selected card permanently.

- ***Wildcard Addition:*** Generate a random card with any suit and value.

- ***Regroup Function:*** Shuffle the currently displayed cards randomly.

## Technologies Used

- ***ReactJS:*** For building the user interface with components.

- ***CSS:*** To style the application and create a professional look.

- ***Git:*** For version control with frequent commits to document progress and issues.

## How It Works

1. ***Click on the Deck:*** Adds a randomly selected card to the displayed list.

2. ***Deal 5/7 Buttons:*** Automatically deals 5 or 7 random cards, clearing any previously displayed cards.

3. ***Reset Button:*** Clears all displayed cards and resets the deck.

4. ***Card Selection and Swapping:*** Click on a card to "pick" it. Clicking another card swaps their positions.

5. ***Toss Button:*** Deletes the picked card permanently.

6. ***Wildcard Button:*** Adds a random card that may duplicate existing cards in the deck.

7. ***Regroup Button:*** Shuffles the order of displayed cards randomly.

## Summary

This React application showcases the effective use of components, state management, and user interaction in a web app environment. It serves as both a learning project for mastering ReactJS fundamentals and a practical tool for demonstrating component-based design patterns.
